# SOVN

**The consent layer between human creativity and artificial intelligence.**

---

## Who This Is For

- **Artists** who want sovereignty over how AI uses their music, stems, and vocals
- **Developers** building AI music products who need legally-cleared, consent-verified audio data
- **Labels and industry players** seeking a standard infrastructure for ethical AI licensing

## Who This Is NOT For

- Those looking to scrape or acquire unlicensed training data
- Artists unwilling to engage with AI music licensing at any level
- Developers seeking free or gray-market audio datasets
- Anyone expecting a marketplace, streaming service, or distribution platform

## Diagnosis of the Problem

The AI music industry was built on extraction. Billions of songs, voices, and stems were scraped without consent, compensation, or control. Artists discovered their sound inside AI models they never approved. Developers built products on creativity they never paid for.

**The core failure:** There was no consent infrastructure. No system existed where artists could define terms, where developers could verify rights, and where compensation flowed automatically. The relationship between human creativity and AI was never built—it was bypassed entirely.

This creates three cascading problems:
1. **Artists have no agency** — their legacy is used without permission or payment
2. **Developers face legal exposure** — every training dataset is a potential lawsuit
3. **The industry has no standard** — ethical AI music cannot scale without infrastructure

## Guiding Policy

**Play to our strengths: Be the infrastructure, not the product.**

SOVN is not a tool. It is not a marketplace. It is the protocol layer—the single point of consent verification between all artists and all AI systems.

**Core principles:**
- **Artist sovereignty is absolute** — creators set terms (training allowed, generation allowed, or neither), and those terms are permanent and enforceable
- **Developer clarity is non-negotiable** — one API, one licensing path, zero legal ambiguity
- **Scale requires a standard** — SOVN succeeds when it becomes the infrastructure that labels, independents, and AI companies align around

## Strategy 1: The Artist Vault

**Objective:** Establish SOVN as the canonical source of consent-verified music assets.

**Actions:**
1. Build a lossless upload system for tracks, stems, and vocals with robust metadata preservation
2. Create a granular permissions framework: training rights, generation rights, derivative rights—each independently toggleable
3. Implement transparent, automatic payouts when assets are licensed
4. Partner with independent artists and small labels first—volume and legitimacy before major label negotiations

**Success metric:** A critical mass of consent-verified audio that developers cannot ignore.

## Strategy 2: The Developer API

**Objective:** Make SOVN the path of least resistance for ethical AI audio data.

**Actions:**
1. Ship a REST API with clear endpoints for browsing, filtering (genre, mood, BPM, asset type), and licensing
2. Provide single-click licensing with transparent pricing and unambiguous terms
3. Offer batch licensing for training datasets with full audit trails
4. Position SOVN as legal insurance: "Built with SOVN" becomes the standard for defensible AI music products

**Success metric:** AI music companies adopt SOVN as their primary data source because the alternative—legal risk—is untenable.

---

## The Outcome

When both strategies succeed, SOVN becomes the bridge where AI earns the right to human creativity—or doesn't cross.

Artists retain sovereignty. Developers build cleanly. The industry has its standard.

**SOVN.** The protocol for the next century of sound.
